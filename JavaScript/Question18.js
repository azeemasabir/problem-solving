/*
Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.

A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.

For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms.

The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms.

If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.

Debounce Schematic

The above diagram shows how debounce will transform events. Each rectangle represents 100ms and the debounce time is 400ms. Each color represents a different set of inputs.

Please solve it without using lodash's _.debounce() function.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
t = 50
calls = [
  {"t": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {"t": 75, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{"t": 125, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
let start = Date.now();
function log(...inputs) { 
  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs ])
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms
The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms. The inputs were (2).

//EXPLANATION

/*
Explanation:
var debounce = function(fn, t) { ... }:

We define a function debounce that takes two arguments: fn, the function to be debounced, and t, the delay in milliseconds.
let timeoutId;:

We declare a variable timeoutId to keep track of the active timeout. This will help us cancel any previous function execution if needed.
return function(...args) { ... }:

The debounced function is returned. It takes any number of arguments (...args) which will be passed to the original function fn when it is eventually called.
if (timeoutId) { clearTimeout(timeoutId); }:

If a previous call to the debounced function was made within the delay window (t milliseconds), this cancels the previous execution by clearing the timeout using clearTimeout(timeoutId).
timeoutId = setTimeout(() => { fn(...args); }, t);:

A new timeout is set to execute the function fn after the specified delay t. The function is called with the arguments passed to the debounced function.
The timeoutId is updated with the new timeout ID, so it can be cleared if the function is called again before the timeout completes.
Example Usage:
const log = debounce(console.log, 100);:

Creates a debounced version of console.log with a delay of 100 milliseconds.
log('Hello'); // cancelled:

The first call to log schedules the execution of console.log('Hello') after 100ms.
log('Hello'); // cancelled:

The second call to log happens before the first call’s delay has passed. The first scheduled execution is cancelled, and a new one is scheduled.
log('Hello'); // Logged at t=100ms:

The third call happens within the delay window, cancelling the previous one. After 100ms, console.log('Hello') is executed.
